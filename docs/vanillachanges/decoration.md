## Decoration

### Block of Ender Pearls
![Block of Ender Pearls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Craft a Block of Ender Pearls from 9 ender pearls.  If a silverfish burrows into an Ender Pearl Block, it will turn into an Endermite.  Eating a Chorus Fruit will teleport you to the nearest Ender Pearl Block rather than a random location.  Both features are configurable.

### Bookcases
![Bookcases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
A bookshelf that has 18 inventory slots for storing books.
It provides the same enchanting power as a normal bookshelf as long as there is at least 1 slot occupied, and can be crafted from each of the 8 vanilla wood types.

The texture will change as books are added or removed.

Contents can be measured using a comparator, outputting a signal based on the number of filled slots rather than the quantity of items.

### Candles

Candles are made from beeswax and have a lower ambient light than torches.
By default, candles must be lit using a flint and steel.

**Beeswax** is produced by smelting Honey combs.
